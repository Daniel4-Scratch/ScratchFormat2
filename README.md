ScratchFormat is a browser extension created in 2017 to make Scratch comments  
a little bit less boring. The current version includes Markdown formatting,  
breakline detection, a linkifier, and much more.

This repo is a complete rewrite from Scratch, very fast and small compared  
to the older versions.

## QNA:
### Make it work for other people who don't have it installed.
There have been requests for ScratchFormat to work for people who do  
not have the extension installed. If you think about it, this is obviously  
impossible, there is nothing I can do about it.  

## NOTE:
There have been requests for ScratchFormat to work for people who do  
not have the extension installed. This is obviously impossible, there  
is nothing I can do about different users.
